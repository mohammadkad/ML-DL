### Subfields of artificial intelligence:
- Perception
- Machine learning (ML)
  - Deep learning (DL) : Using multi-layered non-linear function approximation, typically neural networks.
- Expert systems
- Planning
- Natural language processing
- Computer vision
- Robotics
- Search
- Logic

### There are three main branches of ML: 
- Supervised learning (SL)
- Unsupervised learning (UL)
- Reinforcement learning (RL)
  - Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is the intersection of reinforcement learning and deep learning.
